    <textOnly>Hello {!Contact.FirstName},

We haven’t spoken in while, how are you doing? The last time we spoke you were interested in (package/tool) but you needed to speak with someone from your company first. Let’s all hop on a call to talk it over!

We’re coming up on our deadline and I wouldn’t want you to miss out on this opportunity to market your 2021 Five Star award! Please give me a call so that we can set up a time for us to speak.


I look forward to hearing from you!

Thank you,

{!Contact.OwnerFullName}
