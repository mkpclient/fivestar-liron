    <textOnly>Hello {!Contact.FirstName},

I’m reaching out to let you know that the deadline for your market is coming up this Friday!! If you’d still like the opportunity to market your 2021 Five Star award winner status and reach those marketing goals we discussed, please give me a call ASAP. I’d hate for you to miss out this year!


I look forward to hearing from you!
