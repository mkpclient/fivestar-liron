    <textOnly>Hello {!Contact.FirstName},

You have an exclusive opportunity to appear in one of the most respected media brands in the nation â€“ Fortune magazine! A small group of Five Star award winners in the nation will be recognized in the October/November issue of Fortune magazine. Participants will appear in a section called Women in Wealth, a section focused on outstanding women wealth managers from Five Star Professional.

There are many benefits to participating:

1) You receive national exposure. You are able to leverage your personal brand with one of the most-respected media and financial brands in the nation. Your friends, family and clients alike, throughout the entire country, will be able to see you in Fortune!

2) An e-reprint of your appearance. This will allow you to leverage the brand power and name recognition of Fortune year-round!

3) An announcement letter highlighting your appearance. Share this letter with your network for expanded exposure of your Fortune appearance.

4) Up to 100 physical reprints and a magazine issue to use in new client presentations and with your current and past clients to gain referrals!

Additionally, there are two levels of exposure available to suit your business needs: a listing with your name, company name and phone number, or a sixth-page profile featuring your photo, logo and contact information.

Who wouldn&apos;t want to work with someone seen in Fortune? These are customized reprints, including your photo. Past Fortune participants have found these reprints to be one of the most effective marketing tools they have ever used.
