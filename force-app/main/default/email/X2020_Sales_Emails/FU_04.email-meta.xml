    <textOnly>Hello {!Contact.FirstName},

Our deadline for your market is today. I believe the tools in the package we discussed will help you reach your goals and the worst thing that could happen is that you wanted to use the tools, and we missed out.

Please let me know if you are planning on moving forward this year so I can make sure you are well taken care of.

Thank you,
