    <textOnly>Hello {!Contact.FirstName},

I am following up on a voicemail I just left with you. We have an exclusive opportunity for you to appear in some of the most respected media brands in the nation â€“ Forbes Magazine, the Wall Street Journal, or Fortune Magazine! These sections are selective, specifically for Women in Wealth and for the Five Star Professional Wealth Managers in the Twin Cities.

This is your chance to harness the power of these brands, connect them to your personal brand, and gain national recognition from your friends, family and clients alike, throughout the entire country.

Click here to review the offerings for our Women in Wealth section launching in Forbes.

Click here as well to review options for the Wall Street Journal in the Twin Cities region or Fortune Magazine.

Please give me a call back to discuss as soon as possible!
