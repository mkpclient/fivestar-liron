    <subject>Five Star Award - Purpose of Certification Appointment</subject>
    <textOnly>Hello {!Opportunity.First_Name__c},

I understand that you have questions about the 30-minute appointment regarding the Five Star award. This additional step, the certification process, is crucial for the award determination process. Candidates must successfully complete this step to be named a winner. This additional step has been added for the following reasons:

To make sure candidates verify their regulatory/customer complaint history (from the time they provided their initial candidate information until now).
To ensure candidates/winners understand the award process/criteria - we have found that there are winners who are unsure why they were selected and then misrepresent the award.
To review research changes including more stringent criteria and how this has resulted in fewer winners.
To review award usage guidelines to make sure that winners do not misstate or misuse the award, and by doing so damage the overall credibility of the Five Star award / brand.

I expect that you have worked very hard to develop your reputation and protect your personal brand. The certification process (requiring only 30 minutes of your time) is one additional step we have implemented to make sure that the Five Star brand is protected and properly represented. We want to make sure the Five Star brand helps elevate your personal brand. That is one of the reasons all award candidates must complete the certification process. Other candidates have told us that they appreciate the fact we have implemented this step because they have seen misuses/misstatements in the marketplace regarding the Five Star award. The new certification process is one additional step to protect the Five Star brand and the personal brand of all of our winners.

I hope this provides you a better understanding of the certification process and I hope to hear back from you soon about completing your certification appointment.

If you have any questions, please contact me at any time.

Thank you,
