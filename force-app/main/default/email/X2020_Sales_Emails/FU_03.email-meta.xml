    <textOnly>Hello {!Opportunity.First_Name__c},

I am checking in as it has been a little while since we last spoke. Please let me know when we can connect to finalize the tools you&apos;d like to use this year to drive referral activity and make an impact on client acquisition.

The Package you were considering can be found here: (AM Insert Proposal Link)

Please let me know of a better time to connect with you so I can ensure you are well taken care of.

Thank you,
