    <textOnly>Dear {!kugo2p__SalesOrder__c.kugo2p__ContactBuying__c},

We have received your request to cancel your Five Star Professional order {!kugo2p__SalesOrder__c.Name} placed on {!kugo2p__SalesOrder__c.Release_Date__c}. 

Unfortunately, we cannot cancel your order due to all the products that have either been delivered or are in process at this time.  

I have attached a copy of your invoice and copied your Customer Success Representative and Account Manager in case you have questions for them about the products or use of them. 

There is a great value in using the award you won as part of your marketing plan.  Your Customer Success Representative would be happy to discuss your products with you. *For questions about your products, please contact your Client Success Representative: 888-438-5782, option 1

Thank you for your business and have a great day.
