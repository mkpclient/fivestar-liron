    <textOnly>Dear {!kugo2p__SalesOrder__c.kugo2p__ContactBuying__c},


We have a three day cancellation period.  Your order was placed on {!kugo2p__SalesOrder__c.kugo2p__OrderDate__c} and we are past the three days.  You were published in the {!kugo2p__SalesOrder__c.Publication_Month__c} issue of {!kugo2p__SalesOrder__c.Market_Publication__c} as a Five Star winner.


We cannot cancel your order due to all the products that have been delivered or are in process at this time.  Your order was placed on a finance free twelve month payment plan per your request.  You have made * of the twelve payments.  You can pay the balance due of {!kugo2p__SalesOrder__c.kugo2p__BalanceDueAmount__c} at any time. To be clear, this is a payment plan on a product package that you purchased it is not a monthly subscription you can cancel at any time.


I have attached a copy of your invoice and copied your Customer Success Representative and Account Manager in case you have questions for them about the products or use of them.


There is a great value in using the award you won as part of your marketing plan.


Thank you for your business and have a great day.


Accounts Receivable
