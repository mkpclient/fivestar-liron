    <textOnly>Dear {!kugo2p__SalesOrder__c.kugo2p__ContactBuying__c},


Thank you for your recent business.  We look forward to a continued business relationship.

Our records show that your recent credit card payment was declined.  Your payment plan has been suspended until we can charge a valid credit card.  We understand credit cards are lost or compromised and subsequently need to be cancelled.  Often automatic payments are overlooked, which is certainly understandable.

Please call us at your earliest convenience to provide us with your new credit card information and we will re-establish your credit card payment plan.


Kind regards,

Accounts Receivable 
Five Star Professional
