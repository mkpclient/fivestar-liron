    <textOnly>Dear {!Payment__c.Contact__c},

Thank you for doing business with Five Star Professional. We look forward to a continued business relationship.


Your credit card ending in {!Payment__c.Last_Four_Digits__c},was declined on {!Payment__c.Date__c} for {!Payment__c.SalesOrder__c}. Declined for the amount of ${!Payment__c.Amount__c}. Your payment plan has been suspended until we can charge a valid credit card account. We understand credit cards are lost or compromised and subsequently need to be cancelled. Often automatic payments are overlooked, which is certainly understandable.


Please call us at your earliest convenience to provide us with your new credit card information and we will re-establish your credit card payment plan.


Regards,

Accounts Receivable

Five Star Professional
