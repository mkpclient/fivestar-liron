    <subject>RE: Differentiate yourself from the competition!</subject>
    <textOnly>Hi {!Opportunity.Email_Templates_Informalname__c},


I just left you a voicemail detailing how you can gain credibility with prospects and differentiate yourself from the competition using some of Five Star Professional&apos;s marketing tools.



I&apos;ve helped some of the top-producing professionals in the {!Opportunity.Email_Templates_Market_City__c} area. I&apos;d like to connect with you some time over the next couple of days to talk about how you can use some of those same strategies to grow your business.
