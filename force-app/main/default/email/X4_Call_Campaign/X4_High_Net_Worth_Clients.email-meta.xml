    <subject>RE: Here&apos;s how to attract high-net-worth clients</subject>
    <textOnly>Hi {!Opportunity.Email_Templates_Informalname__c},


I just left you a voicemail detailing how I can help you engage high-net-worth clients using the marketing tools offered by Five Star Professional.



I&apos;ve spoken to some of the top-producing professionals around the country, helping them attract high-value clients, stand out from the competition, and maximize referrals. I would like to connect with you sometime over the next couple of days to talk about how you can do the same.
