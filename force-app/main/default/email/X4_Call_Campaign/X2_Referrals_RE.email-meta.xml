    <textOnly>Hi {!Opportunity.Email_Templates_Informalname__c},
 
I just left you a voicemail detailing how you can use some of Five Star Professional&apos;s tools to leverage your status as an award winner, and gain more referrals

I&apos;ve helped some of the top producing professionals in {!Opportunity.Email_Templates_Market_City__c} use Five Star&apos;s services to maximize their referrals and differentiate themselves from the competition. I&apos;d like to connect with you sometime over the next couple of days to talk about how you can use some of those same strategies to grow your business.
 
2015 Five Star {!Opportunity.Email_Templates_Profession_c} Award Guide
