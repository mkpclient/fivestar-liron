Congratulations on your selection as one of the 2015 Five Star {!Opportunity.Email_Templates_Profession__c}s. The special section will be appearing in the  {!Opportunity.Email_Templates_Month__c} {!Opportunity.Email_Templates_Issue_s__c} of {!Opportunity.Email_Templates_Magazine__c}.


We are excited that you have the opportunity to appear in the award section again this year.

I want to answer any questions you have about how you were chosen for the award. If you have a few minutes to talk, please send me an email with a time that works best for you, or call me at your convenience.
