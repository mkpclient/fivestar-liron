    <subject>Incomplete Five Star Award Status - Please Call to Resolve</subject>
    <textOnly>Hello {!Contact.FirstName},

Just following up on my call to you just now! We look forward to speaking with you about the Five Star award! Please use the tool below to schedule a 30-minute meeting:


*If you are unable to click the button above, please Click Here

You will need access to a computer for this meeting. In the meeting, we will review the award selection process, award criteria, marketing usage guidelines, and confirm your eligibility. Without this 30-minute phone meeting, your award winner form will remain incomplete and we will NOT be able to name you as a 2021 winner.

If you have any questions, please contact me at any time.

Thank you,
