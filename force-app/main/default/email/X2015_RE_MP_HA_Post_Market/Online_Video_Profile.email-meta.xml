    <textOnly>Hi {!Opportunity.Email_Templates_Informalname__c},


It was nice connecting with you today.

I wanted to follow-up with some additional information on our new Online Video Profile. This is a great tool for increasing your visibility online and showcasing your achievements. The Online Video Profile consists of an enhanced profile page with a personalized video that easily embeds in social media platforms, blogs, e-mail signatures and more. 

Here are a few easy ways to use the Online Video Profile:

Paste the link or embed the video directly in the awards, news, blog or other sections of your company or personal website.
E-mail a link to your clients and prospects and/or include a consistent link in your e-mail signature.
Instantly share on Linkedin, Twitter, Facebook and other social networking platforms.
Upload your video on Youtube (the #1 place people watch video and the #2 search engine).
Incorporate in prospect and client presentations.

Remember, you can provide custom bullets highlighting your specialties, two personalized photos and links to your listings, website and social media pages.

If you have any questions, please do not hesitate to contact me.


Thank you.</textOnly>
