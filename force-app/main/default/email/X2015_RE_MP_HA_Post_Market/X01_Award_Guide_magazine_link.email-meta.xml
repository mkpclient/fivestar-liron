    <textOnly>Hi {!Opportunity.Email_Templates_Informalname__c},


Thank you for your time today.  I enjoyed speaking with you!

I’d like to recommend our new 2014 wall plaque. Our wall plaques have recently been upgraded to include a compelling design page on raised glass overlay with high end finishes and wood options of high quality mahogany or black. The new plaques are designed to shine in your office, and generate great conversation with clients and peers as you share the news about your award and magazine appearance. Please access the link below for samples and specifications:

Here are just a few easy ways the wall plaque can work for you when you hang it on the wall in your professional office, office lobby or conference room:

While introducing yourself or reviewing your credentials, be sure to mention your award to clients, prospects and colleagues while using the plaque as  a reference piece
Let clients, prospects and colleagues see the plaque and take note of your accomplishments (enhancing your image and validating your credibility)
When clients and colleagues comment on the plaque, thank them for their loyalty, support and referrals – all contributing to your success and the growth of your business
When sharing the news of your award with existing clients, take the opportunity to ask for a new referral
The wall plaque can be a great segway for sharing a copy of your Five Star press release, distributing article reprints or referencing your desk award to reiterate your success.


Pricing:

Single Wall Plaque $225



Double Wall Plaque $325

Thank you.</textOnly>
