    <subject>Finalizing your award eligibility</subject>
    <textOnly>Hello {!Contact.FirstName},

Congratulations on being nominated by your clients for the Five Star award!

Although the Five Star award is in all major metro markets and is the largest and longest-running award program for {!Contact.Core_Profession__c}s in the United States, I am sure you have questions, as it is new to the {!Contact.Core_Market_city__c} market.


The Five Star award is not a pay to play award program. Award winners do not pay to be considered or to be named a winner. All winners of the award in the {!Contact.Core_Market_city__c} market will be listed on fivestarprofessional.com and will be listed at no cost in the {!Contact.Core_Publication_month__c} issue of {!Contact.Core_Magazine_name__c}.



Later today I will call you to set up an over the phone appointment. The purpose of the appointment is to finalize your eligibility and selection as a 2018 Five Star {!Contact.Core_Profession__c}. During the appointment we will:


路  Review the award process and criteria and how you became a finalist for the award

路  Verify and update your regulatory/customer complaint history

路  Review award usage guidelines

路  Finalize how you wish to be listed (assuming we are able to certify/finalize your award eligibility and selection)

Thank you!
