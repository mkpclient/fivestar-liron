    <subject>You are going to miss out on the benefits of this year’s Five Star award</subject>
    <textOnly>Hello {!Contact.FirstName},

I am following up on our last conversation. It’s your last chance to take full advantage of this year’s Five Star award, and I am concerned that you will miss out.

Below is a sample Client Success Tracker report, which documents the results of a sample Five Star campaign. The results of every campaign is tracked and reported back to purchasers throughout the campaign year.




I don’t want you to miss out on generating the results you need to achieve your business and growth objectives. Please give me a call at the number below!
