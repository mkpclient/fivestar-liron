    <textOnly>Hello {!Contact.FirstName},


We&apos;ve not been able to finalize the 2018 Five Star {!Contact.Core_Profession__c} award with you for the upcoming Five Star section in {!Contact.Core_Magazine_name__c}. We&apos;ve attempted to connect with you to complete it, but have been unsuccessful as yet in doing so. The deadline is fast approaching.


At this point you will neither be named a 2018 recipient, nor listed in the Five Star section that appears in {!Contact.Core_Magazine_name__c} this year. Were you intending to participate? We need 20+ minutes to finalize this year&apos;s award and walk through the options that are available to you. Please give me a call at the number below!


Best wishes,
