    <textOnly>Hello {!Fulfillment__c.PrimaryRecipient__c},

Your {!Fulfillment__c.Product_Name__c} product is ready! To access it, log in to your account on our website.

Username: {!Fulfillment__c.Web_Username__c}
Password: {!Contact.Login_Code__c}

NOTE: if you&apos;ve already set your password, use that rather than this login code



Go to My Orders on the right side of your Five Star account and look for &quot;Five Star Monthly HEAT Index.&quot;
If you don&apos;t see it right away, click the grey bar at the bottom that says &quot;To view your complete list of orders click here!&quot;
Click &quot;view&quot; to view and download your HEAT Index to share with your clients. By doing this, you&apos;ll display your market knowledge and stand out from the competition.

If you don&apos;t see your picture on your customized HEAT Index, be sure to upload one to your Five Star Professional profile so it appears on next month&apos;s HEAT Index.
