    <subject>Forbes Real Estate Market Leaders - are you participating?</subject>
    <textOnly>Hello {!Contact.FirstName},

You have an exclusive opportunity to appear in one of the most respected media brands in the nation -- Forbes magazine! A small group of Five Star award winners in your market -- up to 20 real estate agents or mortgage professionals -- will be recognized in the February 2019 issue of Forbes magazine. Participants will appear in a section called &quot;Real Estate Market Leaders.&quot; Prior Real Estate Market Leaders sections published in Forbes have been enormously successful. We expect your market to sell out in the coming weeks.

There are many benefits to participating:

1) You receive national exposure. You are able to leverage your personal brand with one of the most-respected media and financial brands in the nation. Your friends, family and clients alike, throughout the entire country, will be able to see you in Forbes!

2) A brand new Forbes Banner for your email, websites and more! This will allow you to leverage the brand power and name recognition of Forbes year-round!

3) 100 physical reprints to use at listing presentations and open houses -- and of course with your current and past clients to gain referrals!

Who wouldn&apos;t want to work with someone seen in Forbes magazine? These are customized reprints, including your photo. Past Forbes participants have found these reprints to be one of the most effective marketing tools they have ever used.

There are a limited number of spots available and they are selling fast. I&apos;d hate to see you get left out. If you&apos;d like to participate, call me as soon as possible to reserve your place!

Thank you,
