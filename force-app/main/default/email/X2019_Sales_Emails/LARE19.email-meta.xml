    <textOnly>Hello {!Contact.FirstName},

My apologies. Due to an error in our database, you received an email that you shouldn’t have. As of now, you are certified as a Five Star winner – there are no additional steps you need to take to become an award winner for this year. Our technology team is addressing the database error that caused this.

Please let me know if there’s anything I can help you with.


Sincerely,


Thank you,
