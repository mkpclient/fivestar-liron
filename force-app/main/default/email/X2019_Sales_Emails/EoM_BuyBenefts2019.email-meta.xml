    <subject>You are going to miss out on the benefits of this year’s Five Star award</subject>
    <textOnly>Hello {!Contact.FirstName},

It’s your last chance to take full advantage of this year’s Five Star award, and I am concerned that you will miss out.


Here is a copy of your personal Client Success Tracker report, which documents the results of your Five Star campaign from last year.

Based on its results, I believe you will be missing out on significant value this year (not to mention, you will not see the enhancements we have made to the offering this year – including VIDEO!).



Please review the link above. Once you take a look, please give me a call at the number below!
