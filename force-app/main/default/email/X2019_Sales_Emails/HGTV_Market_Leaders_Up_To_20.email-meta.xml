    <textOnly>Hello {!Contact.FirstName},

I am following up on my voicemail that I left you.

I would like to position you among only 15 Five Star Real Estate Agents in a HGTV Magazine special section entitled Real Estate Market Leaders. Highlighted market leaders are grouped by major metropolitan city within the State of California and the section will appear in the October, 2019 issue.

I think this is an exceptional opportunity that when marketed, will help activate your referral network and help you win more prospective client presentations.

Please call me to discuss.


Thank you,
