    <textOnly>Hello {!Contact.FirstName},


I am following up on the voicemail I just left you.



My understanding is that you were not fully satisfied with your experience with Five Star Professional last year. The pdf link below connects you to you Client Success Tracking Report:

This report summarizes your order last year. I would appreciate the opportunity to review this report with you and address any shortfalls in your experience. I am committed to making sure you are fully satisfied with your Five Star Professional experience.


Please give me a call at 651-259-1959. I look forward to speaking with you!

Thank you,
