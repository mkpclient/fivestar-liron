    <subject>Your Listing in Five Point Magazine</subject>
    <textOnly>Hello {!Contact.FirstName},

In the (Insert Market) edition of Five Point Magazine, which will be published in (Publication Month), you will be highlighted as a Five Star Home/Auto Insurance Agent. There is no cost for you to appear in the publication, it is just another benefit of being selected as a Five Star award winner.

Because Five Point Magazine is new to the (Insert Market) area we are reviewing the magazine with all award winners. I’m just looking for 5 minutes of your time so I can show you the publication and how you will appear, so you aren’t surprised. Please call me or click below to schedule an appointment:
