    <subject>You were nominated again - Five Star Professional Award</subject>
    <textOnly>Hi {!Opportunity.Email_Templates_Informalname__c},

Your clients have nominated you again for this year&apos;s Five Star {!Opportunity.Email_Templates_Profession__c} Award!

We know how busy you are, for easy reference we uploaded your responses from last year, to make it easier for you to complete your candidate form. I also wanted to let you know of new criteria* we have added for the 2017 award program.


All candidates need to complete a candidate form to be considered for the award. Award winners will be featured with a complimentary listing on the Five Star Professional website, www.fivestarprofessional.com, and have the opportunity to appear in a special section of the {!Opportunity.Email_Templates_Month__c} issue of {!Opportunity.Email_Templates_Magazine__c}.

To complete your evaluation, you can access the link by clicking on &quot;Your Form&quot; below.


Candidate Evaluation Form - Click Here to Complete
The deadline to submit is end of day  {!Opportunity.ACDF_Deadline__c}

Award winners are scheduled to be notified within three to six weeks of the deadline.

If you have any questions please feel free to give me a call or send me an email.

*Blue Ribbon Panel -  As part of the award evaluation all candidates will be reviewed by our Blue Ribbon panel of local real estate agents. As a member of the Blue Ribbon Panel you will be asked to take 15-20 minutes to review a portion of the candidate list. You will be asked to provide feedback on whether someone should be removed from consideration or someone should be added to the pool of candidates.


*10-minute Award Winner Certification appointment  - Our new final step in our research process is a 10-minute Award Winner Certification appointment to determine that there have been no changes to your candidate form and also review the Award Usage Guidelines.


Thanks,
