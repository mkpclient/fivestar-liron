FAQ&apos;s:
How was the research conducted?
We reach out to recent home buyers in your area and ask them to complete a customer satisfaction survey based on a set of criteria for {!Opportunity.Profession_Type__c} that they have worked with. How we got your name, is at the time of the survey they give us the name of the professional they would like to be recognized.

What&apos;s the next step?

What&apos;s the catch?
There is no catch. Our company offers a variety of tools that become available to award winners that are designed to create new opportunities by leveraging and marketing the award. By participating there is no obligation to purchase any of these products should you be named an award winner. Please note that purchase of these products has no bearing what-so-ever on whether someone wins the award or not.
