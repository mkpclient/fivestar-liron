    <textOnly>Hello {!Opportunity.First_Name__c},

Thank you for responding. Just to help me better understand, is there any particular reason on why you have decided to not participate in the program this year since you have been a recipient of the award? I appreciate any feedback you can share with me, as we want to make sure we are offering a valuable award program for {!Opportunity.Profession_Type__c} and obviously we must be missing the mark somewhere.

Just a reminder that you do not have to purchase anything to be considered for the award, or to be named an award winner. If you are named a 2023 award winner you still receive a complimentary listing on the Five Star Professional website;  www.fivestarprofessional.com for the year and in the {!Market__c.Publication_Month__c} issue of {!Market__c.Magazine_Text__c}.

If you do change your mind and would like to participate, the deadline is {!Opportunity.ACDF_Deadline__c}. You can use this link to complete your candidate form; {!Opportunity.Research_Form_URL__c}
