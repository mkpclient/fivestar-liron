    <subject>Information incomplete for Five Star Professional award</subject>
    <textOnly>Hello {!Opportunity.Email_Templates_Informalname__c},

I need to connect with you regarding your incomplete status with the Five Star Professional award program for this year.  We have made some changes to our award process to improve the quality and exclusivity of our winner list and to be named a winner, I must connect with you.

I am seeking a 10-minute meeting with you when you will have access to a computer, so we can review any changes and confirm your eligibility. Without this 10-minute phone meeting, your award winner form will remain incomplete and we will NOT be able to name you as a 2017 winner.

Please contact me at {!Opportunity.OwnerPhone} if you don&apos;t reach me, please leave me a message with a couple of dates and times that would work with your schedule. You can also reply to this email with dates and times or schedule a time to talk using the tool, www.scheduleonce.com.

Kind regards,
