    <textOnly>Hello {!Contact.ACDF_FName__c},

If there&apos;s one thing you must do in a competitive market, it is to differentiate yourself from other professionals. As a research-driven, third-party recognition, the Five Star award can help you do this!

Marketing the Five Star award can:

Give you an edge over your competition
Help to maximize new business opportunities
Generate referrals and reinforce your brand

Don&apos;t miss your opportunity to differentiate yourself from your competition. We can build a plan that will help you overcome your business challenges and make the most of your status as a Five Star award winner.

Give me a call or request an appointment to discuss how you can use the Five Star award in your marketing plan!
Thank you,
