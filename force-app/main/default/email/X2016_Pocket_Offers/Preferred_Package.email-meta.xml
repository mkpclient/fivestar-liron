Hello, {!Contact.ACDF_FName__c}!




It was great speaking with you today! To follow-up on our conversation, I would like to offer you our Preferred Package which includes:

Quarter-page profile
Award emblem
100 two-page reprints of your magazine profile appearance

The list price for this package is over $XXXX, but I can offer it to you for 10% off!



As we&apos;ve discussed, this package is our tried-and-true, go-to combo to successfully leverage the Five Star award.

The quarter-page profile gives you fantastic exposure in {!Opportunity.Email_Templates_Magazine__c} and boosts your brand by associating your business with both the Five Star award and your local media.
Use the award emblem digitally and in print as a mark of differentiation.
Reprints are the no. 1 way to make your appearance in the magazine work for you. Include them in client handouts, direct-mail pieces, or at open houses.
