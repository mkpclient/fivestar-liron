    <textOnly>Hello {!Fulfillment__c.FName__c},

I just wanted to remind you that you have an active subscription for &lt;PRODUCT NAME&gt; and we need you to sign-in to your Five Star account and submit/verify your information so we can get started on your campaign!

You can access your Five Star account by going to: www.fivestarprofessional.com/login.

Here is your login information:

Username: {!Fulfillment__c.Web_Username__c}

Passcode: {!Fulfillment__c.Login_Code__c}

Once you are signed in, you will want to click on the red &quot;View Products&quot; button under &quot;General Marketing Products&quot;. From there, click &quot;View&quot; next to &lt;PRODUCT NAME&gt; to submit your information and get started.

Please contact me if you have any questions, or if you need assistance with any of this. I am here to help you!

Thank you, I am looking forward to working with you on your campaign!
