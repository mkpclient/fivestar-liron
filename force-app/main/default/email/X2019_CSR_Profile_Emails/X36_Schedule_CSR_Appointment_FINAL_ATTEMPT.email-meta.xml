    <textOnly>Hello {!Fulfillment__c.FName__c},

Iâ€™ve made several attempts to reach you but this will be my last attempt. Please feel free to reach out to me and set up an appointment by using the scheduling link below when you have approximately 20 minutes for me to walk you through the products you purchased.

{!Fulfillment__c.CSR_Sumo_Link__c}

It&apos;s very important that we connect and schedule your Five Star Client Success appointment to discuss the steps you need to take to submit materials to us so we can create your products for you. We want to make sure you are set up for success with your products and that you get the most out of them.

You will need access to a computer for this meeting. In our meeting, we will discuss the steps you need to take to submit materials, access your tools and ideas for how to use your tools.

We will review your available products and the materials you need to submit on your Five Star account at www.fivestarprofessional.com/login
