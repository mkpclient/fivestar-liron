    <textOnly>Hello {!Fulfillment__c.PrimaryRecipient__c},

We’ve created a new report that shows you the progress and results of your Five Star Professional marketing tools. You can view your tracker by clicking here: {!Fulfillment__c.Client_Success_Tracker_URL__c}

The Client Success Tracker is designed to help you track your Five Star Professional marketing tools by showing you the engagement and interaction you’ve had so far and highlighting some additional things you can do to get the most out of the campaign.

Please take a look and don’t hesitate to reach out to me with questions regarding the report or your Five Star Professional marketing tools.

You can also set up an appointment to discuss and review your tools in more detail with your dedicated Client Success Representative by clicking here: {!Fulfillment__c.CSR_Sumo_Link__c}

Thank you,
