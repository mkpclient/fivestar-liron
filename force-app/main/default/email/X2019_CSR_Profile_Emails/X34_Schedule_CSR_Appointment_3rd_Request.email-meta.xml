    <textOnly>Hello {!Fulfillment__c.FName__c},

Iâ€™ve made a few attempts to reach you. It is important that we connect and schedule your Five Star Client Success appointment to discuss the steps you need to take to submit materials and access your tools. I want to make sure you have enough time to submit materials and get the most out of your products. Please use the link below to schedule your 20-minute client success meeting:

You will need access to a computer for this meeting. In our meeting, we will discuss the steps you need to take to submit materials, access your tools and ideas for how to use your tools.

We will review your available products and the materials you need to submit on your Five Star account at www.fivestarprofessional.com/login
