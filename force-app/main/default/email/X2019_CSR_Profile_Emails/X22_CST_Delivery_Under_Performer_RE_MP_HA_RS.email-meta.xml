    <subject>Your Five Star Professional client success tracker is ready!</subject>
    <textOnly>Hello {!Fulfillment__c.FName__c},

We’ve created a new report that shows you the progress and results of your Five Star Professional marketing tools. You can view your tracker by clicking here: {!Fulfillment__c.Client_Success_Tracker_URL__c}

The Client Success Tracker is designed to help you track your Five Star Professional marketing tools by showing you the engagement and interaction you’ve had so far and highlighting some additional things you can do to get the most out of the campaign. 

It looks like the engagement numbers on your social posts could use some help. Remember, the best way to get the most engagement out of your social posts is to share them so your friends, family and connections can like, comment and share your post to expand your network even further!

Please take a look and don’t hesitate to reach out to me with questions regarding the report or your Five Star Professional marketing tools.

You can also set up an appointment to discuss and review your tools in more detail with your dedicated Client Success Representative by clicking here: {!Fulfillment__c.CSR_Sumo_Link__c}

Thank you,
