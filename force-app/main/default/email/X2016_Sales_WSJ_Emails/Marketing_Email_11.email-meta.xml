    <subject>The Wall Street Journal: Are you a wealth manager people need to know?</subject>
    <textOnly>Hello {!Opportunity.ACDF_Fname__c},


As a Five Star Wealth Manager, you have the exclusive opportunity to appear regionally in a full-page feature within The Wall Street Journal as one of the 10 Five Star Wealth Managers consumers need to know. This feature will run in The Wall Street Journal&apos;s Wealth Management Journal Report, a special section that runs six times a year and addresses the issues that matter most to affluent investors and advisors. Review offer details: {!Opportunity.Market_Guidebook_with_Price__c}

This is a rare chance to reach a key group of prospects and differentiate yourself from other wealth managers in your area. Our Wall Street Journal showcase offerings are first-come, first-served, and only a handful of spots are available.

Iâ€™m excited to be able to offer you this! To raise your visibility and secure your spot, or hear more about this offer, please call me at {!Opportunity.OwnerPhone} or request an appointment time.
