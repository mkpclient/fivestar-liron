    <textOnly>Hi {!Opportunity.Email_Templates_Informalname__c},

Five Star award winners get the greatest impact from their award when they share the news using a variety of media. Whether it’s online, via print or on display, we offer many options from which to choose.

We have a special promotional offer that allows you to select any combination of three or more marketing tools and receive 30% off the total price.*

Contact me for more information about how you were selected, how you will appear in {!Opportunity.Email_Templates_Magazine__c} and more options available to you. Or go to our Award Guide.
