    <textOnly>Hello {!User.FirstName},

Just a quick reminder to submit your nominations for the Five Star Professional Employee Recognition Program. It’s an awesome way to recognize the great work your colleagues are doing. During the quarterly meetings, one winner will be drawn from all of the nominations received for that quarter.

Enter in your nomination HERE

Program Details:
• Any FSP employee may nominate any other FSP employee – cross-departmental nominations are encouraged!
• To submit a nomination, use the nomination form here:
• Prize winners will be chosen from all nominees during the quarter and announced at the company-wide quarterly meeting.

For a refresher on how to submit the nominations through your Salesforce user page, watch this quick video HERE.
There are a lot of great things going on around here so let’s recognize each other’s efforts!

As always, if you have any questions, don’t hesitate to stop by or drop me a line.

Thanks,
